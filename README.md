# ü§ñ Discord-SelfBot
This is a simple Discord bot that utilizes the discord.py library to delete messages sent from you in a Discord Server or Direct Message. The bot can clear all messages in a specific channel or in Direct Messages with a single command, making it easy to clean up cluttered chat history. 

# üîß Prerequisites
Before using this bot, it is important to make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system, your Discord account token, and most importantly discord.py version 1.7.3, which is not the latest version but newer versions don't allow you to use a user's token instead only a bot token.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Discord.py 1.7.3 - Run the command in your terminal. 
   -  Windows -> py -m pip install -U discord.py==1.7.3
   -  Raspberry Pi -> pip install -U discord.py==1.7.3
* [Discord Account Token](https://www.androidauthority.com/get-discord-token-3149920/) **NEVER GIVE YOUR TOKEN TO ANYONE**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Extra Configuration
